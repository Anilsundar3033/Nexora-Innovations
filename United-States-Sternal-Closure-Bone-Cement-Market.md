It is used in various cardiovascular surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), heart valve repair, and heart transplants. The United States sternal closure bone cement market benefits from the growing number of median sternotomies performed annually. Bone cement helps in providing stability to the sternum after the procedure, ensuring that patients recover effectively with minimal complications such as nonunion, instability, or infection. The application of bone cement in median sternotomy significantly reduces the recovery time and improves the overall success rates of these complex surgeries. In addition, the hemisternotomy procedure is gaining prominence, particularly for patients who require a more limited surgical approach than the median sternotomy. Hemisternotomy involves a partial sternum incision, typically on one side of the sternum, to access the heart. This technique is less invasive and generally associated with lower postoperative complications. The use of sternal closure bone cement in hemisternotomy applications serves to reinforce the sternum, preventing any dislocation or failure in healing. It also plays a critical role in reducing patient pain and enhancing the recovery process. As minimally invasive surgeries continue to grow in popularity, the application of bone cement in hemisternotomy is expected to further contribute to the market's expansion. Bilateral thoracosternotomy is another application in the sternal closure bone cement market. This procedure involves the surgical separation of both sides of the sternum, often performed in high-risk cases such as major heart surgeries, transplants, or for patients who require dual access to both sides of the chest. While this surgery is more complex and typically involves a longer recovery time, the application of bone cement ensures that the sternum heals properly and maintains structural integrity. The growth of bilateral thoracosternotomy in the U.S. has led to increased demand for sternal closure bone cements, which help provide better fixation, strength, and durability for the sternal bone post-surgery. The ongoing development of advanced bone cement formulations specifically designed for such complex surgeries is expected to foster further growth in this subsegment. <p>Key Trends in the Market:</p> <p>One of the key trends driving the United States sternal closure bone cement market is the increasing emphasis on minimizing post-surgical complications, such as sternal instability and infection.
